//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car

// and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of
// keyword arguments. Call the function with the required 
//information and two other name-value pairs, 
//such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s
// returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
