//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
// Create a variable called alien_color and assign 
//it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

//color is green. If it is, print a message that 
//the player just earned 5 points.

//Write one version of this program that passes the if test 
//and another that fails. (The version that fails will 
//have no output.)
