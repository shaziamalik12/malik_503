//Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds an 
//Object describing a music album. 
//The function should take in an artist name and an album title, 
//and it should return an Object containing these two pieces of 
//information. 
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing 
//different albums. 
//Print each return value to show that Objects are storing 
//the album information correctly. 
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to
// store the number of tracks on an album. 
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks,
// add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
//Make at least one new function call that includes the number 
//of tracks on an album.
